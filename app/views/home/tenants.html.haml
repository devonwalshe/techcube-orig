Our pricing is based on a tiered system which is designed to be flexible and responsive to early stage startups. We go through an assessment process before agreeing terms - so a pre-money startup will pay less than a company growing and turning a profit. TechCube provides functional, adaptable office space in a range of sizes and configurations, with market-leading comms and networking, bookable meeting rooms and plenty of cool social and breakout space - making us the destination for Edinburgh tech companies.
